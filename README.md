# upskillHub
UpskillHub is a learning platform that allows users to connect based on their profiency in subjects, as well as 
what they wish to learn.

Users populate a presented field, enter credentials and fill out the relevant learning fields.

We then provide courses to users based on the skill they wish to learn, which will be managed via the PluralSights
API.

```Project Goals```

- Use a hosted Postgresql server to store data.
- Use JavaFX to build a desktop app based front end to the application.
- Use an external API (such as with PluralSight) to fetch recommended courses to users, based on what 
skills they wish to learn.

```Installation Steps```
- You will find JUNIT installed under the "lib" directory of the project.
