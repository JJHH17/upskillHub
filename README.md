# upskillHub
UpskillHub is a learning platform that allows users to connect based on their profiency in subjects, as well as 
what they wish to learn.

Users populate a presented field, enter credentials and fill out the relevant learning fields.

We then match users with other learners based on what they wish to learn.

We will finally recommend PluralSight courses to the users, based on their desired skills.

```Project Goals```

- Use a hosted Postgresql server to store data.
- Use JavaFX to build a desktop app based front end to the application.
- Use an external API (such as with PluralSight) to fetch recommended courses to users, based on what 
skills they wish to learn.
- I will also be using TDD (Test Driven Development) on this application, using JUNIT.
